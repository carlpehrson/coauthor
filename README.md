# Coauthor
Automate the process of adding co-authors to git commits

# Setup
Currently the only way to get Coauthor to your environment is get it through
cargo (the package manager bundled with rust) directly through source

```sh
cargo install --root ~/.cargo --git https://github.com/carlpehrson/coauthor coauthor
```

# Usage
_Currently not documented, please see `coauthor help` for documentation._

# Development
Assuming you have cargo (the package manager bundled with rust) installed
you should only have to:

```sh
# Run the test suite
cargo test

# Run the tool
cargo run
```
